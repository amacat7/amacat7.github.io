    <h2>HOW TO PLAY!</h2>
    <p>This is the best game. Tremendous game! You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. I mean look at this game. Have you ever seen anything like this before? I have tons of people, they come up to me, they say, Trump, this is the best game. No one has ever gotten that kind of endorsement. I mean, just look at this game. It's really just the best.</p>
    <p>A lot of people ask me, Trump, how do you play the game? That's a great question, and I mean we are going to talk about that. Playing the game and knowing the rules is what it's all about. I mean you can't play if you don't know, but we will talk about it.</p>
    <p>A friend of mine, really great friend, told me, Trump, just press the space bar and the arrow keys. Tremendous design. You really can't get any better than that.</p>
